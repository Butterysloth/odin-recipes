        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna 
                recipe, the filling contains ricotta and 
                parmesan with seasonings and a couple of 
                tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? 
                No problem, cottage cheese works just 
                fine in this recipe!</li>
            <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and 
                ground beef for great flavor. If using 
                all beef, add a Â¼ teaspoon of fennel 
                seeds and some Italian seasoning to 
                the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
            <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use 
                pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it's easy 
                to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes 
                and canned tomatoes if you'd prefer).</li>
            <li>Spinach (variation): To make a spinach 
                lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture 
                of defrosted frozen spinach and add it 
                along with the cheese layer.</li>
        </ul>
