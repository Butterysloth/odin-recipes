        <p>Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, 
            but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s 
            worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!
            <br>
            The best lasagna recipe is made with 
            ingredients that you know, and it’s not 
            difficult at all! All you’ll need for this 
            easy lasagna recipe is one pan, one bowl, and
            a 9x13 baking dish!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna 
                recipe, the filling contains ricotta and 
                parmesan with seasonings and a couple of 
                tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? 
                No problem, cottage cheese works just 
                fine in this recipe!</li>
            <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and 
                ground beef for great flavor. If using 
                all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel 
                seeds and some Italian seasoning to 
                the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
            <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use 
                pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it's easy 
                to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes 
                and canned tomatoes if you'd prefer).</li>
            <li>Spinach (variation): To make a spinach 
                lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture 
                of defrosted frozen spinach and add it 
                along with the cheese layer.</li>
        </ul>
